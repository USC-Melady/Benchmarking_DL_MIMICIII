# Vagrant VM for MIMIC III

See: [mimic-iii-vm](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-iii-vm)

Vagrant allows you to easily automate the creation of virtual machines.
The [mimic-iii-vm](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-iii-vm) repository will
create a virtual machine with Vagrant, download version three of the
MIMIC III data, and make it accessible to you via command line or graphical
interface with a single command.

The automated steps performed on the VM are similar to those in the
[Install MIMIC locally](http://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install_mimic_locally/)
instructions on the official website.

<hr>

If you would like to use the MIMIC II data, please use the
[mimic-ii-vm](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-ii-vm) repository, instead.
