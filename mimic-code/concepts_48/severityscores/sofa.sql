-- Title: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
-- This query extracts the sequential organ failure assessment (formally: sepsis-related organ failure assessment).
-- This score is a measure of organ failure for patients in the ICU.
-- The score is calculated on the 2 day of each ICU patients' stay.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Reference for SOFA:
--    Jean-Louis Vincent, Rui Moreno, Jukka Takala, Sheila Willatts, Arnaldo De MendonÃ§a,
--    Hajo Bruining, C. K. Reinhart, Peter M Suter, and L. G. Thijs.
--    "The SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score to describe organ dysfunction/failure."
--    Intensive care medicine 22, no. 7 (1996): 707-710.

-- Variables used in SOFA:
--  GCS, MAP, FiO2, Ventilation status (sourced from CHARTEVENTS)
--  Creatinine, Bilirubin, FiO2, PaO2, Platelets (sourced from LABEVENTS)
--  Dobutamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine (sourced from INPUTEVENTS_MV and INPUTEVENTS_CV)
--  Urine output (sourced from OUTPUTEVENTS)

-- The following views required to run this query:
--  1) uo2day - generated by urine-output-2-day.sql
--  2) vitals2day - generated by vitals-2-day.sql
--  3) gcs2day - generated by gcs-2-day.sql
--  4) labs2day - generated by labs-2-day.sql
--  5) bloodgas2dayarterial - generated by blood-gas-2-day-arterial.sql
--  6) echodata - generated by echo-data.sql
--  7) ventdurations - generated by ventilation-durations.sql

-- Note:
--  The score is calculated for *all* ICU patients, with the assumption that the user will subselect appropriate ICUSTAY_IDs.
--  For example, the score is calculated for neonates, but it is likely inappropriate to actually use the score values for these patients.
